This is my first attempt at blogging, I still don't know what to expect.
I will probably write about the following topics :

  * Programming, especially using [functional][ocaml] [languages][haskell].
  * Development of the [Debian] operating system.
  * [Static analysis] of software.
  * Computer security.

Like some of [my][chmd-static] [friends][nicdumz-static], I decided to use a
static blog generator. The first series of posts will be about setting this up
with [hakyll], git and S3. Stay tuned !
