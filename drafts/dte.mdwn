title: ROM Hacking 101: altering strings

We use the following file:

    68 e
    72 i
    77 n
    79 p
    98 s
    99 t
    101 v
    103 x
    239 ' '

It seems to work well!

    ...e ..  .ppe...n.e... neve.         expe.te. ... t. .. s. .e.......            
     ... s..... n.t  ..ve ..ne t.e.e...t see.e. t.    .e ..st . .itt.e.i..i...t....n
    se.ve ..e..  ..n.t ... .n..  it is expensive..... ...ppe. t.. ..st. ....ine   s.
    i.in. ...n    . ...p..  .... .in.s      ..nn.t t....    t.e ....n....eep t.e n.s
    e .pin t.e .i.. n.t ....in. .n t.e  ....n.......in. is ...e st.i.t .n t.e   .e.t

I add an option so that we can output only part of a file. Here the relevant
offsets seem to be between 0x19780 and 0x1cf00.

It seems that the letters are encoded in a sequential fashion: let's add all the
letters between 72 i and 79 p. This works well:

    19a80 pe..e.tt.e skills ne.ess... .o..o.  to  e..n   .e.ti.i..tion....
    1a400 .in....omplete lesson in .n.e. ....   .o. .. .oints...o... . .in

However, it can not be continued: the gap between p and s is too big. Usually
this means that in the font, the letters are not in sequence, but rather
organized as a matrix.

Now we can guess several other letters by completing words. For example
"sk..ivin." is probably "skydiving".
