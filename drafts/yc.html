            <h1>YC W13</h1>

<p>by <em>Etienne Millon</em> on <strong>No date</strong></p>

<p>Tagged as: .</p>

<p>Y Combinator is a seed accelerator for startups located in San Francisco Bay Area. Put simply, the Bay Area is the best place to start a technology startup and YC is the best accelerator there.</p>
<p>Since 2010, I have been working on and off with my friend <a href="https://research.facebook.com/researchers/911353072242054/gabriel-synnaeve/">Gabriel Synnaeve</a> on a product that could become a company. The idea is that we receive data everyday from a lot of sources, and a lot are not directly relevant to you. Our goal is to aggregate this feeds and sort them according to how likely you’re going to read them. Our pitch became the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cloverfeed is a website and a mobile application to rank and filter entries from all your feeds: RSS, Facebook, Twitter, social news… It’s like a spam filter and “priority inbox” for all your notifications. With this service, we want to empower our users to be more efficient reading their news feeds, starting with ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doing this would be nice, but was a lot of work. We were both preparing our PhD and unwilling to jump the boat and work on this full-time, so the idea cooked a few years.</p>
<p>In August 2012, we saw the usual “apply for YC” announce on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> and decided to apply. It would mean moving to California in January but by then we would both have graduated and officially on the job market. The perfect time to start a company.</p>
<p>Getting into YC is a two-step process. First, you have to fill an application form that explains who you are, what you are going to work on, and why you’ll succeed. Then, you’re invited to present your project at Y Combinator headquarters in California. If the interview goes well you’re invited to work <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/atyc/">at YC</a> on your product.</p>
<h3 id="the-application">The application</h3>
<p><a href="yc/app.html">Here</a> is our application for YC W13, with some parts redacted. Some questions were straightforward to answer, but others are quite tough to answer. The hard part is to show that we will stick together.</p>
<p>A few beers later the application was done, though. I distinctly remember spending a lot of takes on the video. Staying serious while pitching to a webcam is not so easy…</p>
<p>In parallel to the application, we started to build a prototype. Our goal was to have an MVP by December, between the interview and YC itself. We used a quite standard Python web stack using Pyramid. It was the first time we used an asynchronous task queue in a project (to fetch feeds and compute indexes), and Celery gave us its share of headaches.</p>
<p>TODO gab machine learning backend: clojure, tika, scikit-learn</p>
<p>We used mostly things we were comfortable with, but assembling stuff together is always challenging :)</p>
<p>At this point we weren’t so sure about our application. We had no traction, no users, almost no prototype. We did this mostly so we have a canvas for future applications for YC as well as other accelerators since the format is mostly the same.</p>
<p>It turned out better than expected as we got an email inviting us to an interview in Mountain View.</p>
<h3 id="lets-go-to-silicon-valley">Let’s go to Silicon Valley</h3>
<p>There is a relatively short period of time between the notification and the interview itself, so we had to get ready and quick. For me, Silicon Valley was <em>terra incognita</em> but fortunately Gabriel had already gone there a few times. He was fortunate enough to meet Arjun Vasan, who was at the time at the head of the aptly-named Hacker Fortress. Staying there was a natural choice as it would be a great opportunity to work on our project there.</p>
