Y Combinator is a seed accelerator for startups located in San Francisco Bay
Area. Put simply, the Bay Area is the best place to start a technology startup
and YC is the best accelerator there.

Since 2010, I have been working on and off with my friend [Gabriel Synnaeve] on
a product that could become a company. The idea is that we receive data everyday
from a lot of sources, and a lot are not directly relevant to you. Our goal is
to aggregate this feeds and sort them according to how likely you're going to
read them. Our pitch became the following:

> [Cloverfeed] is a website and a mobile application to rank and filter entries
> from all your feeds: RSS, Facebook, Twitter, social newsâ€¦ It's like a spam
> filter and "priority inbox" for all your notifications. With this service, we
> want to empower our users to be more efficient reading their news feeds,
> starting with ourselves.

Doing this would be nice, but was a lot of work. We were both preparing our PhD
and unwilling to jump the boat and work on this full-time, so the idea cooked a
few years.

In August 2012, we saw the usual "apply for YC" announce  on [Hacker News] and
decided to apply. It would mean moving to California in January but by then we
would both have graduated and officially on the job market. The perfect time to
start a company.

Getting into YC is a two-step process. First, you have to fill an application
form that explains who you are, what you are going to work on, and why you'll
succeed. Then, you're invited to present your project at Y Combinator
headquarters in California. If the interview goes well you're invited to work
[at YC] on your product.

### The application

[Here][YC App] is our application for YC W13, with some parts redacted.

Some questions are straightforward, but others are quite tough to answer.

One of the important things that you will want to convey is that your group will
stick together.

Indeed, YC focuses a lot in the fact that groups of two persons are the best:
solo founders are [usually a bad signal][PG Startup Mistakes] and more than two
persons mean that there can be a conflict between the founders and that majority
can lead to bad decisions and bad feelings.

Because being 2 is so important, finding a co-founder is a problem with some
people, and the application is the first place where YC partners will be able to
assess the strength.

We think that for us it's not a problem as we've known each other for a long
time and have worked together already, but still conveying that takes some work.

The other important point is to show that you're working on an interesting
problem, ie one that is [desirable, buildable and profitable][Bruce Sterling
NEXT13]. Desirable means that the problem exists. Buildable means that the ones
that are affected by the problem can become your clients. Profitable means that
you will be able to pay your bills with this problem.

In parallel to the application, we started to build a prototype. Our goal was to
have an MVP by December, between the interview and YC itself. We used the
following stack:

  - web backend: pyramid
  - ORM: sqlalchemy, alembic
  - DB: postgresql, sqlite
  - frontend: bootstrap, deform
  - queueing: celery, rabbitmq
  - ML backend: clojure, tika, scikit-learn
  - infrastructure: EC2

Mostly things we were comfortable with, but assembling stuff together is always
challenging :)
