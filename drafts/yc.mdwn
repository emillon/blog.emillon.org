Y Combinator is a seed accelerator for startups located in San Francisco Bay
Area. Put simply, the Bay Area is the best place to start a technology startup
and YC is the best accelerator there.

Since 2010, I have been working on and off with my friend Gabriel Synnaeve on a
product that could become a company. The idea is that we receive data everyday
from a lot of sources, and a lot are not directly relevant to you. Our goal is
to aggregate this feeds and sort them according to how likely you're going to
read them.

Doing this would be nice, but was a lot of work. We were both preparing our PhD
and unwilling to jump the boat and work on this full-time, but the idea cooked a
few years.

In August 2012, we saw the usual "apply for YC" announce  on [Hacker News] and
decided to apply. It would mean moving to California in January but by then we
would both have graduated and officially on the job market. The perfect time to
start a company.

Getting into YC is a two-step process. First, you have to fill an application
form that explains who you are, what you are going to work on, and why you'll
succeed. Then, you're invited to present your project at Y Combinator
headquarters in California. If the interview goes well you're invited to work
[at YC] on your product.

### The application

When developing the product we arrived to the following pitch.

> [Cloverfeed] is a website and a mobile application to rank and filter entries
> from all your feeds: RSS, Facebook, Twitter, social newsâ€¦ It's like a spam
> filter and "priority inbox" for all your notifications. With this service, we
> want to empower our users to be more efficient reading their news feeds,
> starting with ourselves.
