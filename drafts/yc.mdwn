Y Combinator is a seed accelerator for startups located in San Francisco Bay
Area. Put simply, the Bay Area is the best place to start a technology startup
and YC is the best accelerator there.

Since 2010, I have been working on and off with my friend [Gabriel Synnaeve] on
a product that could become a company. The idea is that we receive data everyday
from a lot of sources, and a lot are not directly relevant to you. Our goal is
to aggregate this feeds and sort them according to how likely you're going to
read them. Our pitch became the following:

> [Cloverfeed] is a website and a mobile application to rank and filter entries
> from all your feeds: RSS, Facebook, Twitter, social news… It's like a spam
> filter and "priority inbox" for all your notifications. With this service, we
> want to empower our users to be more efficient reading their news feeds,
> starting with ourselves.

Doing this would be nice, but was a lot of work. We were both preparing our PhD
and unwilling to jump the boat and work on this full-time, so the idea cooked a
few years.

In August 2012, we saw the usual "apply for YC" announce  on [Hacker News] and
decided to apply. It would mean moving to California in January but by then we
would both have graduated and officially on the job market. The perfect time to
start a company.

Getting into YC is a two-step process. First, you have to fill an application
form that explains who you are, what you are going to work on, and why you'll
succeed. Then, you're invited to present your project at Y Combinator
headquarters in California. If the interview goes well you're invited to work
[at YC] on your product.

### The application

[Here][YC App] is our application for YC W13, with some parts redacted.
Some questions were straightforward to answer, but others are quite tough to
answer. The hard part is to show that we will stick together.

A few beers later the application was done, though. I distinctly remember
spending a lot of takes on the video. Staying serious while pitching to a webcam
is not so easy…

In parallel to the application, we started to build a prototype. Our goal was to
have an MVP by December, between the interview and YC itself. We used a quite
standard Python web stack using Pyramid. It was the first time we used an
asynchronous task queue in a project (to fetch feeds and compute indexes), and
Celery gave us its share of headaches.

TODO gab
machine learning backend: clojure, tika, scikit-learn

We used mostly things we were comfortable with, but assembling stuff together is
always challenging :)

At this point we weren't so sure about our application. We had no traction, no
users, almost no prototype. We did this mostly so we have a canvas for future
applications for YC as well as other accelerators since the format is mostly the
same.

It turned out better than expected as we got an email inviting us to an
interview in Mountain View.

### Let's go to Silicon Valley

There is a relatively short period of time between the notification and the
interview itself, so we had to get ready and quick. For me, Silicon Valley was
*terra incognita* but fortunately Gabriel had already gone there a few times. He
was fortunate enough to meet Arjun Vasan, who was at the time at the head of the
aptly-named Hacker Fortress. Staying there was a natural choice as it would be a
great opportunity to work on our project there.
