title: Binary distributions are like static type systems

As programmers, we're used to hear the same debates over & again: vim vs emacs,
static vs dynamic typing, interpreted vs compiled, XML vs JSON, binary vs
source, etc. The list goes on.

I'm usually not interested in these "religious wars". Actually, if both
alternatives exist and have survived, it means that they are a local maximum
evolution and that both have pros and cons. That is to say, you can pick the one
you prefer, or the one that is the most appropriate for the job ; while
respecting the existence of an alternative. Same foes for, e.g., music: there is
no point in trying to convince a metal fan that electronic music is better.

Among these debates, one is particularly interesting to me: source vs binary
distributions. The former ones provide sources that will be compiled on the
user's machine; the latter ones provide a set of precompiled binary files that
are downloaded from the network.

As I said, there are pros and cons for both of these systems: in a nutshell,
source distros are more flexible and binary distros are more convenient. For
example, if a package can be compiled with a set of options, they can be chosen
*à la carte* in a source distro.
