### Gaming

When I was younger, I enjoyed a lot japanese RPGs on the SNES. Stories
were nice, combat systems were nice, these games were AA.

But now, don't enjoy too much stuff with too much theme in it. For
example, I prefer games like [Puerto Rico][BGGPuertoRico] to
[The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow][BGGWerewolves]. Of course, it's a
very different kind of game but what I like about Puerto Rico is that
like many European games, the theme is completely optional. It could
take place in Alaska, the Balkans, or ancient China and still be the
same game. What's important is that you

### Roguelikes & Brogue

Roguelikes are a type of game which are a descendant of the venerable
[Rogue][WPRogue]. The most notorious is probably [NetHack]. [Brogue], which I'll
talk about here, is a more modern roguelike, which is certainly easier for
beginners. It looks like… that:

As it's quite abstract, this screenshot can be read as this:

  - `@` is the player. You control its position using the hjkl keys to move it
    like in vi, and using yubn to move it diagonals.
  - `#` are walls.
  - `.` is an empty spot (you can walk over it).
  - `"` is grass. It's like an empty spot, except that it can burn.
  - `~` is water. As you can see, it's animated and beautiful (sort of).
  - `r` is a rat. There are a lot of different enemies in Brogue, with different
    characteristics. Rats are the weakest type, and are usually defeated in a
    hit.
  - `Ω` is the dungeon's exit. The goal of the game is to exit the dungeon,
    which is challenging because to unlock the exit door, you have to be in
    possession of the Amulet of Yendor which is on level 26. That is to say, you
    have to make your way through 26 levels full of enemies down and back up
    (the ascension is quite easy, though).
