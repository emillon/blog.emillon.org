The freeze is coming.
It's a good time to make a bit of summary of my contributions during this
release cycle.

## New packages

[subliminal] is a tool to automatically download subtitles for movie files.
Packaging it required to also package a few of its dependencies that were not
available in Debian: [babelfish], [enzyme], [guessit], and [pysrt].

[glyr] is a library to query lyrics sites. I packaged it because the new
version of gmpc requires it, but at the moment it is just a leaf package.

## Usual work on my packages

[gmpc] and [gmpc-plugins] did not change a lot. Upstream is working on a big new
version but it is not released yet. During this Debian cycle, I did mostly
janitorial work: I disabled outdated provider plugins, enable multi-arch
support, and ported to a recent version of Vala.

[rss2email] got a new upstream maintainer. This is really great since the code
needed some love. The whole program got rewritten in Python 3, and this mandated
a major version bump, creating the rss2email 3.x branch.

One of the side-effects of this rewrite is that the configuration file format
changed. Actually the 2.x version used a plain python file for configuration,
which was `eval()`uated within the program's context. Now it is based on
ConfigParser. The on-disk state file, which serializes what feeds you are
subscribed to, and what is the last time you refreshed them, changed its format
too from a pickle file to a JSON file.

This incompatibility is necessary and welcome, but is tough to manage within the
context of a software distribution. If a user upgrades his packages, he should
find his programs working as before. So, I wrote a `r2e-migrate` script that
converts a 2.x state file to a 3.x state file. Designing a clean upgrade path
was very interesting. Indeed, it is not possible to do this during the package
installation: since the config and state files are in every user's $HOME, it is
necessary to wait for each user to do his migration. The solution I arrived at
was that when rss2email 3.x starts, and has no state file, it checks if a
rss2email 2.x exists. Then it prompts the user to run `r2e-migrate`. A few
iterations were necessary before it worked as I wanted, so I am happy to have
used the experimental suite for this. Once everything was working I uploaded the
package to unstable and it seems to work well. I am very happy with how this
went, and I could close a lot of bugs in this package, also thanks to the new
responsive upstream.

[visualboyadvance] only got cosmetic changes. A patch for fixing the build with
the new GCC flags, enabling hardening etc. I somehow missed the notification
email for an important bug (#740292) that I merged but unfortunately it is too
late to include it in Jessie. I would like to give the package more love for the
next release, maybe including the newer vba-m version.

[zsnes] is an interesting package to maintain because it's written in x86
assembly and has been dormant upstream for a few years now. During this release
cycle there were no real breakthroughs, but a lot of little niceties. For
example, we now have a debug package, and build packages for kfreebsd and the
hurd. Enabling hardening options also made us discover several memory
manipulation errors.

I would like to include a more recent upstream snapshot, but the whole situation
seems to be a little complicated as there seem to be several forks lying around.

## New packages I'm taking care of

I have the pleasure of being the new maintainer for [feedparser], a Python
library for parsing RSS and Atom feeds. It is my most popular package: according
to popcon, 40% of users have it installed! During this released, I ported back
the work made on the Ubuntu, and worked on providing a Python 3 version of this
package.

## Given package

In 2012 I started to take care of the coin* packages. I adopted [coinor-cbc] and
began to plan a transition plan for all the related packages, but because of a
lack of time and interest I did not go all the way.

Fortunately Miles Lubin proposed to adopt these packages and is doing a great
work on them. Thanks Miles!
