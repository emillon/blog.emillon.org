I have been listening to podcasts since 2007 or so, and I love this medium.
Here is the ones I listened to the most in 2014.

  - [Serial].
    This is the one that made podcasts fashionable again at the end of 2014.
    I am sure you have heard about it, but it tells the story of a murder case
    back in 1999. The specific part that is interesting in my opinion is that it
    depicts the thought process of the journalist, Sarah Koenig. This is because
    the podcast started to air while the reporting was still under way. Along
    the episodes, we are wondering with Sarah "whether or not Adnan did it".
    This raises a lot of questions on the ethics of this project of course.
  - [Giant Robots Smashing into other Giant Robots Podcast]. Every week, Ben
    Orenstein interviews people from the tech scene. I must say that he is a
    great interviewer and that the selection is always good.
  - [The Bike Shed], also hosted by thoughtbot, more focused on code, especially
    Rails. So far, so good.
  - [Healthy Hacker]. Same kind of energy as Giant Robots, but the structure is
    a lot different. Chris Hunt starts with a "workout of the week" and then
    goes on and talk about a subject he likes. Sometimes there are guests.
  - [Michel Platiniste]. Shameless plug. That's my podcast. With a few friends,
    we record mixes of (mostly) electronic music. We have a series of mixes
    called The Pomodoro Sessions which are episodes of 25 minutes designed to work
    with [the pomodoro technique].
  - [Radiolab]. Generic science stuff. It alternates full-length episodes of
    approximately one hour and short episodes of twenty minutes or so. This is
    well produced and the storytelling is often exciting, but the quality varies
    a lot. I recommend the ["Colors" episode].
  - [Stack Exchange Podcast]. What can I say: I do not even use Stack Exchange
    and yet I listen to their podcast. Once more, the hosts' quality counts a
    lot. If Joel Spolsky hosted an hour-long daily show I would listen to it. In
    this podcast the team discusses new features and challenges that they have
    to scale the site. What I like is that most of these challenges are not
    technical, but mostly human. This is more of a podcast on how to build a
    community. I got hooked on it after listening to the episode where they
    tell how they recovered from [hurricane Sandy].
  - [Type Theory Podcast]. Very technical but since type theory is one of my
    scientific interests, I tried. It requires some concentration, to say the
    least. So far I am not persuaded that this is the good medium for this.
  - [Wide Teams]. Focusing on distributed teams and remote workers. Nice to see
    how different people accomodate. Too bad that this podcast is on hold at the
    moment.
