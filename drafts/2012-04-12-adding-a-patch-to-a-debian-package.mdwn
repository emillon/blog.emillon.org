title: Adding a patch to a Debian package

A few years ago, I decided to step up and maintain [a few packages in
Debian][DDPO].

The community is great, and I highly recommend it to everyone
interested.

Being a maintainer is a 

Most of the necessary work is quite easy, but it can be quite

So, I received a [bug report][] by e-mail, stating that zsnes FTBFS ("Fails To
Build From Source") with gcc-4.7. This is a problem, because when the default
gcc in unstable will be 4.7, the build farms won't be able to do their job on
zsnes.

According to Matthias, the error message is :

    tools/depbuild.cpp: In function 'void dependency_calculate(const char*, stat&)':
    tools/depbuild.cpp:168:37: error: 'F_OK' was not declared in this scope
    tools/depbuild.cpp:168:41: error: 'access' was not declared in this scope

The [porting guide](http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.7/porting_to.html) linked in the
bug report states that it is because `unistd.h` is not included by other headers
anymore. This sounds good : the fix will probably be a one-line patch.

Let's fix this bug ! The logical steps are :

  - reproduce the bug
  - prepare a fix
  - check that the bug is fixed
  - post the fix to the Bug Tracking System
  - upload a package containing the fix

Reproduce the bug
-----------------

To build the package with `CC=gcc-4.7 CXX=g++-4.7`, I will manually invoke
`debian/rules` to build the package. Because I use [git-buildpackage][], I have
to manually apply all debian-specific patches before :

      % dquilt push -qa
    Applying patch 0001-gcc-fno-rtti.patch
    Applying patch 0002-replace_crc32.patch

Bug confirmed ! Let's clean the tree and...

Prepare a fix
-------------

Zsnes uses the new "3.0 (quilt)" format, so to add a new patch I just have to
add a new patch in `debian/patches`, add its name to `debian/patches/series`. It
could be done manually or with `dquilt`, but I prefer using `gbp-pq` which comes
with `git-buildpackage`. It's a tool which can converts git commits to a "plain"
patch queue, (as the famous [patch queues][] in Mercurial) :

`gbp-pq import` creates a git branch (named `patch-queue/master`) from the
current patch queue. `gbp-pq export` converts this branch to named patches in
`debian/patches`.

       % gbp-pq import
    gbp:info: Trying to apply patches at 'e8b572dc10dcc44f01e5254d8bb93330215e5050'
    Switched to branch 'patch-queue/master'
    gbp:info: Patches listed in 'debian/patches/series' imported on 'patch-queue/master'
       % vim src/tools/depbuild.cpp 
    [ ... add #include <unistd.h> line ... ]
       % git commit -av

This commit will be the new patch, so let's be quite verbose about changes :

    Fix build with gcc 4.7

    Headers in the new C++ library do not implicitly import unistd.h, so it is
    necessary to do it in the source.

    Bug-Debian: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=667429

The last line is a [DEP-3][] field. While it is optional, it is good practice to
include it to track your patch. `gbp-pq` will automatically add `Subject`,
`Author` and `Date` from the commit metadata.

Once the commit is done, we're still on the patch queue branch. The next step is
to export it to master as a new patch :

       % gbp-pq export
    gbp:info: On 'patch-queue/master', switching to 'master'
    Switched to branch 'master'
    Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
    gbp:info: Regenerating patch queue in 'debian/patches/'.
    # On branch master
    # Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
    #
    # Changes not staged for commit:
    #   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
    #   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
    #
    #       modified:   debian/patches/series
    #
    # Untracked files:
    #   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    #
    #       debian/patches/0012-Fix-build-with-gcc-4.7.patch
    no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

Not only we'll add all those changes to the git index, but we also have to
update `debian/changelog`. As always, there's a tool for this ! `dch` will bump
the last edit date, and add a new changelog line with a "Closes: #nnnnnn"
command. When the package will be uploaded, this will automatically close the
bug in the BTS. Note that this is not a new changelog entry : I already had a
fix for [#438384](http://bugs.debian.org/438384) ready.

       % git add debian/patches/*
       % dch --closes 667429
    [ ... vim opens, edit the last entry ... ]
       % git diff

Check that the bug is fixed
---------------------------

This time, `./debian/rules build` correctly builds the package. The fix was
correct. If it was incorrect, it would be necessary to reiterate the above steps
until a fix was found (using `git commit --amend` on the patch queue branch to
edit the last patch).

In that particular case, it was easy to guess that a one-line fix would be
enough, but for more complex bugs it may be worth to directly hack on
`patch-queue/master`.

Post the fix to the Bug Tracking System
---------------------------------------

To avoid duplication of work, and to allow other users to use your work, it is
best practice to post this patch. The BTS accepts commands on
`control@bugs.debian.org`
