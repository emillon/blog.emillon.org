I've had loads of fun with the Microcorruption CTF that has been organized by
Matasano and Square.

The goal is simple: 20 levels to learn more about embedded systems security.
What is remarkable about this contest is how the difficulty is progressive and
stays reasonable even at the last levels. I managed to validate 18 levels, which
puts me at the time of this writing at rank 213 of 5704. Yay ! At a time I even
was 11th :)
